You are working on a project with multiple team members. The repository has the following branches:
⦁	main / master: The main production branch.
⦁	dev: The development branch where new features are integrated.
⦁	feature1: A feature branch where you are working on implementing a new feature (feature1).
⦁	feature2: A feature branch where another developer is working on a different feature (feature2).

Your task is to:
1.	Ensure your dev branch is up-to-date with the latest changes from main / master.
2.	Create a new branch feature3 from dev and implement a new feature.
3.	After completing the feature in feature3, merge it back into the dev branch.
4.	Handle any merge conflicts that might arise during the merge process.
5.	After successfully merging feature3 into dev, push the changes to the remote repository.
