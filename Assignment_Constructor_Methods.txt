
Assignment 1: (function overloading)

Note **: create function name as "calculate"

create four functions in a class

1) create method of return type int
   - add two numbers

2) one of return type int
   to calculate the area of the circle

3) one of return type int 
   area of the rectangle

3) one of return type int 
   area of the square




Assignment 2:  (method + constructors)
Create class as "Shape" 
i want to calculate the area of the different shapes - square, rectangle, circle
1. create 4 constructors - default contructor + three parameterized constrcutors for the shapes (using constructor overloading)
2. create 3 methods for (square, rectangle, circle) display which will display the value of the area calculated
3. calcuate the area of the rhombus and triangle using the method overloading concept 





Assignment 3: create the 4 student objects with name s1,s2,s3,s4
Declare the class "Student" and create member variables as below:
   - String name
   - int age
   - section(char type)
   - gender (char type)
   - three int subject marks (subject1, subject2, subject3)

(1) Calcuate the total marks and percentage obtained by every student (total= subject 1 + subject 2+ subject 3) by passing the values from the parameterized constructor
(2) For s2 and s3 students pass subject 1 marks = 0 and dont pass it in constructor.
(3) create method display ---> display all the s1, s2, s3 and s4 objects values (all the class variables + total marks + percentage)





Assignment 4:
We have to calculate the percentage of marks obtained in three subjects (each out of 100) by student A and in four subjects (each out of 100) by student B. Create an abstract class 'Marks' with an abstract method 'getPercentage'. It is inherited by two other classes 'A' and 'B' each having a method with the same name which returns the percentage of the students. The constructor of student A takes the marks in three subjects as its parameters and the marks in four subjects as its parameters for student B. Create an object for each of the two classes and print the percentage of marks for both the students.
